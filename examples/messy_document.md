Python lists are one of the most versatile and commonly used data structures in Python programming. They allow you to store multiple items in a single variable and provide numerous methods for manipulation.

## What are Python Lists?

A list in Python is a collection of items that are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values. Lists are created using square brackets:

```python
# Creating a simple list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits)
```

### Adding Elements

You can add elements to a list using several methods:

```python
# Using append() to add single item
fruits.append("orange")

# Using insert() to add at specific position
fruits.insert(1, "grape")

# Using extend() to add multiple items
fruits.extend(["mango", "kiwi"])
```

### Removing Elements

Similarly, you can remove elements in various ways:

```python
# Remove by value
fruits.remove("banana")

# Remove by index
del fruits[0]

# Remove and return last item
last_fruit = fruits.pop()
```

# Traditional way
squares = []
for x in range(10):
    squares.append(x**2)

# Using list comprehension
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
```
